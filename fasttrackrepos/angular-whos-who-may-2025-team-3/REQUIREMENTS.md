## Requirements Overview

A business would like your team to build a guessing/trivia/quiz game. The specific logic and gameplay mechanics for this game are completely up to your team, however your game must include the following:

- A configuration page that allows players to update the game's settings. Once a player adjusts the game with their desired configurations, these settings should persist across multiple local game instances.

- Guessing/trivia/quiz logic while playing the game, whether that be text input, matching, hangman, anagrams, multiple choice, etc.

- Sound effects or audio feedback while playing the game. These sounds should be able to be played/paused or enabled/disabled.

- A game over/win/loss screen that displays a player's final score and allows players to enter their name.

- A leaderboard that displays the names of top scoring players across multiple local game instances. At a minimun, this page should be accessible from the configuration page.
