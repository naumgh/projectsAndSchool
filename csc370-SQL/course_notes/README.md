# A few bits and bobs...

Folks:

I am going to try using this repository to share bits and pieces of
code that you may find helpful for the rest of the term, especially as
you begin to do more work with `psql` and later coding in Python.

You have the ability to **read** from this repository, but not to
write to it. In order to keep things clean, please treat any clone you
have of the repository as read-only, so that any `git pull` you
perform will just bit a fast-forward merge (and not require any
additional supervision on your part).

* `sql/`: Home for some `.sql` files corresponding to things I show in class
(in case you want to Try This At Home).

* `python/`: Home for some Python scripts illustrating ideas shown in
lecture or described on RocketChat.

* `misc/`: Odds and sods of information that I think may be of
interest.
