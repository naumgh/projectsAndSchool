This repository highlights my achievements and expertise within the broader field of computer science. Here is a general breakdown of the repo:

**csc110-Python:** Contains Python projects, mostly coming from an Introduction to Programming class.  There is no previous programming knowledge required for this course. The point of these files is to show proficiency in simple data structures like dictionaries, stacks, queues

**csc115-Java:** Contains Java projects, mostly coming from an Introduction to Programming class. This class is the natural progression to csc110, and the point of these files is to show proficiency in more complex data structures like Binary Search Trees, Linked Lists.

**csc230-Computer-Architecture:** Contains Mars Mips projects, a basic educational assembly language similar to "SPIM". The point of these files is to show proficiency in lower level languages, like MIPS.

**csc355-Digital-Logic:** Contains logic and design projects mostly using a program called "Logicism". The point of these files is to show proficiency in logic and hardware design.

**csc370-Database-Systems:** Contains SQL projects mostly, coming from an intermediate Programming class. The point of these files is to show proficiency in SQL, as well as an understanding of database normalization and management. 

**csc421-Introduction to AI:** Contains AI assignments, mostly coming from an introduction to AI class. The point of these files is to understanding of basic AI principles, such as logical entailment, Bayesian probabilistic models, deep learning, neural networks.

**seng474-Data-Mining:** Contains Data Mining assignments, mostly coming from an intermediate programming class. The point of these files is to show understanding of Data Mining principles, such as Gradient Descent, training models, statistical models, classification

**csc361-Networks:** Contains networking assignments, mostly coming from an intermediate programming class. The point of these files is to show understanding of network fundamentals, such as HTTP communication, SSL/TLS, UDP, and Wire Shark use.

**MISC:** Files to be showcased once complete.
