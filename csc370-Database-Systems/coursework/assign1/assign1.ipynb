    "\n",
    "In order to reduce confusion and errors as you prepare answers, for this assignment you are to use the rename operation (i.e. $\\rho$) in a notation similar to that used for $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$. For instance, the `Sells` relation described in the lectures has attributes `pub`, `beer`, and `price`. If we want to create a new relations `S'` where the attribute `pub` is now called `name`, you can write either:\n",
    "$$ S' = \\rho_{name, beer, price}(Sells) $$\n",
    "or:\n",
    "$$ S' = \\rho_{name / pub}(Sells)$$\n",

Then, it's projecting the sid of the relation given due to the conditions descibed. Finally, it projects the sname from those relations. This query doesn't make a lot of sense, and could have been written better, and simplified. The sid projection wasn't needed. In fact, due to the double precision, we would return nothing!\n",

After this, we are projecting the name of said suppliers. For simplicity, we will denote it SUP1. We are also doing the same thing in the other query (after the intersection), but this time we are finding parts that are color cyan, that cost less than 50, and are supplied by suppliers. We will denote this SUP2. Finally, we are taking the intersection of SUP1 and SUP2 sids, which means we are finding the names of suppliers that meet both conditions previously mentioned.

SUP2 is selecting parts with color charcoal, that cost less than 200 dollars and are supplied by suppliers. Then we are projecting sid from both SUP1 and SUP2, and intersecting said projections.

Then, we are intersecting by SUP2, which is defined by the selection of parts that are colored eggshell-white, that cost less than 100 dollars and are provided by suppliers. Finally, we are projecting sname from SUP1 INTERSECT SUP2. In other words, we are getting the names of suppliers that that meet both SUP1 and SUP2 conditions and projecting it onto a new relation and finally, projecting the sname. \n"
