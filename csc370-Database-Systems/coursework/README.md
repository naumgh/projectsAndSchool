# CSC 370 gitlab.csc repo (Spring 2024)

Each student in this semester's offering of CSC 370 is provided with a
`gitlab.csc.uvic.ca` repository intended to support their coursework.

In addition, this repository is intended for used with the JupyterLab
environment allocated to the course (`https://jhub-cosi.uvic.ca/`).
Each student will clone their repo **only once** into JupyterHub, and
they will also perform many `pull`s and `push`es as needed:
* `push` to submit partially- or fully-completed assignment work for
evaluation.
* `pull` to obtain from the teaching team further assignment
descriptions, assignment evaluations, and any extra needed material.

Assignment #0 material now available to students. Although there is no
credit for this assignment, it will give students and teaching team an
opportunity to identify and correct any issues arising from the use of
`gitlab.csc` together with `jhub-cosi`.
