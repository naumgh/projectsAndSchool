''' Q1.  The Earth zips around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour, making a full revolution in about 365 days - one year on Earth. Mars is a little slower, and farther from the sun, so a full circuit takes 687 Earth days - or one Mars year.

    Design a function called print_planet_age that takes a integer that represents the number of days a person has lived and it prints how old in years the person would be on Earth and on Mars using the information provided above.
    '''

''' Q2. Design a function called print_range that takes two floating point numbers and prints the range of the two numbers inclusive. NOTE: by range we mean print the lowest and highest value that will include all given values within the range from lowest to highest.
    '''


''' Q3. Design a function called is_multiple that takes two integers and prints a message
    telling whether the second number is a muliptle of the first number.
    RECALL: 7, 14, 21 are all mulitiples of the number 7 because 7 divides evenly into each number
    '''


''' Q4.  Design a function called print_as_question that takes as an argument a phrase and prints that phrase with a question mark at the end if there is not already one there.
    Examples:
    •    If the phrase is "hello there" the function should print "hello there?"
    •    If the phrase is "why?", the function should print "why?
    •    If the phrase is "why? what", the function should print "why? what?"
    '''


''' Q5. Design a function called print_max that takes as arguments three floating point numbers and prints the biggest of the three values.
    You MUST NOT use the built-in max function.
    '''


''' Q6. Design a function called print_test that takes a phrase and a boolean expression as arguments. Remember:  the arguments MUST be in this order (the phrase before boolean expression).
    If the boolean expression evaluates to true, the function should print:
        "abc: passed", where "abc" is the phrase
    If the boolean expression evaluated to false, the function should print:
        "xyz: failed", where "xyz" is the phrase
